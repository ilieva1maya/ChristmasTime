# ChristmasTime

Welcome to my first student's project in Angular!

This is a site where Santa's dwarfs can register and start to produce (create) presents. The "work in progress" presents are visible in the warehouse (catalog). The progress of each presenet is reflected (edit) only by the owner. When the present "is ready", it can be finished (delete).

These are the covered functionalities:
* client â€“ server architecture
* collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations
* communication via REST
* authentication
* client-side routing
* error handling and data validation
* reactive and template driven forms

Used frameworks and libraries:
* Angular CLI
* RxJS

Hosting URL: https://christmas-time-fbd76.web.app

Enjoy!
