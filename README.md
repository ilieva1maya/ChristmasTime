# ChristmasTime

Welcome to my first student's project in Angular!

This is a site where Santa's dwarfs can register and start to produce (create) presents. The "work in progress" presents are visible in the warehouse (catalog). The progress of each presenet is reflected (edit) only by the owner and when the is ready, to be finished (delete).

These are the covered functionalities:
* client â€“ server architecture
* collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations
* communication via REST
* authentication
* client-side routing
* error handling and data validation

I was not using consistent approach through the project, for instance:
* reactive and template driven forms
This was with the purposes of my own learning curve, to try different approaches and learn more.
