# ChristmasTime

Welcome to Santa’s Warehouse!

This is where Santa’s elves are hired (register) and start to create presents. The presents in progress are displayed in the warehouse catalog for everyone to see. Each present’s progress can only be edited by its owner (the elf responsible). Once a present is finished and ready, it can be marked as complete (deleted from the system).

These are the covered functionalities:
* client – server architecture
* collection, different from the User collection, with all CRUD operations
* communication via REST
* authentication
* client-side routing
* error handling and data validation
* reactive and template driven forms

Used frameworks and libraries:
* Angular CLI
* RxJS

Bonus features:
* SVG
* Geolocation
* RxJS
* Firebase: Hosting URL: https://christmas-time-fbd76.web.app
